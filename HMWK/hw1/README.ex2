INPUT: 1 Integer(uint32), The number of meters the runner should run
OUTPUT: 2 Integers(uint32), First is the laps, Second is the mters to finish another lap
Algorithm:
1. Take in 1 Int32 integer, denoted by L
2. Take the modulas of L with MetersPerLap(400), denoted by R
3. L = L - R
4. Calculate the laps as Laps = L / MetersPerLap
5. Return Laps and (MetersPerLap-R) in proper form

Note: In this programme, Constant MetersPerLap represents the meters of a single lap, assumed to be 400m.
