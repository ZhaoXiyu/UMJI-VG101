ReadMe_Group_Assignment
INPUT: NULL
OUTPUT: 
The program uses four new functions: 
umalloc and urealc are used to allocate to wrap exceptions of collocation or reallocation.
The resizeset is used to resize the memory for new elements if necessary, 
function bcmp is used to determine whether the element exists in the previous set.

In the newSet we set a a new set and in the deletes we let them be zero. 

The addElem and remElem function are used to add and remove the determined elements.
